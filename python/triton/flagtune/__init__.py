"""Self-contained model integration for FlagTune configuration prediction.

Runtime callers identify a model bundle by
``(platform_key, op_id, variant, dtype_key)``. The bundle supplies
the parameter space, input rules, safe feature expressions, version metadata,
and XGBoost model without prior operator registration::
